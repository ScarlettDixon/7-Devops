### IaC - Configuration Management - Ansible  - 
Ansible is an amazing tool for configuration management, I had been interested previously in automating my Laptop's Arch Installation so that I could make sure it was clean and I was more aware of what was on it, it also helps with setting up environments and combined with Terraform setting up the infrastructure it can be an incredibly powerful tool. Several projects have been created so far.
They include:
##### ArchInstall - 
As I said I want. They'll all be managed using a setup of multiple different roles.
* Setup The Drives
* Install all Software I use
* Setup Security Settings
* Start the software/security services
* Pull in Backed up Information

##### NASSetup - 
This code will not be included in this repository but I have also tested a number of prototype setups one my personal NAS

Being able to create a dockerfile once and bypass that need while being able to simply interact with these containers was an utter relief and great for workflow.
